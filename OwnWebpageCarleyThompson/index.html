    <div class="parent ship-text"> Sailors used to believe that black cats brought their ships good luck. Lil sea kittens. Eating all the fish and mice they want. But if a cat climbed on, then jumped off then the ship was believed to sink...

    <h3>Why Is Carley So Desperate For A Black Cat?</h3>
   
    <div class="fun-text ">You're probably thinking "Carley, it's just a black cat why are you crazy about this." Well listen here I've never owned a cat before. Let a girl dream. The one thing I don't understand is apartments having a pet-rent. The animals don't have jobs how are they supposed to pay it :( Kidding I know it's a fee for the owner but I'm mad about it.</div>
