The web was revolutionary when it was created. And even now it seems to be ever changing and gaining new sites or information. There's endless information to be acessed and feels addicting at times to go down an endless spiral of looking up things. The coding for it is brilliant and I admire those who spend the time to program such extensive things. It's not something I think about it a lot, considering it's been around ever since I was a kid.

However, I think the web knows too much information about Me. Corporations have stuck their greedy hands into the web to get unneccesary information about me as it's user. Which is a major set back but what am I supposed to do? Go fully off the grid and never open the web again? Impossible, especially now with remote learning. 
Though it's very universal, with HTML practically anybody can add and take away from sites.

My rating: a solid 6.7 out of 10. A meh. Could be worse. Could be better. 

A solid C maybe. It's passing, for now....it's on thin ice.
